# Automate Booking on Spond

### 🎇 Background
After a few months of learning how to code, I decided to embark on a personal project that would help me to auto rsvp for my badminton sessions. I play badminton weekly and wanted to automate booking my badminton sessions on Spond due to high popularity and competitiveness to get a spot. 

### ✅ Requirements
- [x] To be able to book badminton sessions using python to interact with a web browser.
- [x] To be able to book badminton sessions using a scheduled job that runs every week.

### 🏃‍♀️ Automation

To run the script weekly, I decided to use GitHub Actions. At first I found it difficult to find the right workflow to use in order to get the Chromedriver working but after some trial and error, I decided to use the workflow created by [jsoma](https://github.com/jsoma/selenium-github-actions) and adjust my `main.py` file.

### 📖 Reflection

I really enjoyed this project and finishing it a year after completing the python script. Many thanks to [Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer) for introducing and teching me Selenium through 100 Days of Code (Python) and [Makers](https://github.com/makersacademy) for introducing me to CI and GitHub Actions which enabled me to automate booking my badminton sessions. 

After completing this project, I was able to pick up and learn more about GitHub Actions and it also gave me the chance to optimise and refine my python script.
